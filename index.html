				<blockquote>
	        <p class="quote">John and I worked together on the JJMDC project. John was a well respected dev lead and was often referred for architectural questions and direction. He was a fantastic lead and had a great focus on onboarding new members, accessing strengths and weakness, encouraging member to continue their education and helping team members work in their weaker areas to make the team stronger. During our time working together at J&amp;J John was an excellent networker and we made several trips to NJ to work with our teams and workshop to move our project forward faster. Our time working together was a formative part of my early working experience and I'm very thankful for all of his guidance.</p>

	        <p class="quote">John Jennings worked in two major projects on Drupal and Salesforce development while I was his manager at J&J. His knowledge of both was influential with helping the business understand the limitations of Salesforce and he was able to work towards a successful platform upgrade and build in Salesforce and Drupal. He was able to present innovative design solutions within both platforms.</p>

	        <p class="quote">I worked very closely with John for over a year, building advanced web applications for the travel industry. He has a meticulous eye for detail and handled technical development tasks exceedingly well. His front-end experience was instrumental in pushing our team forward to learn new SCSS concepts. Even though his back-end development was always superb, it was a nice surprise to have someone on hand with a sharp focus on user experience as well. John filled a role that bridged the divide and has since not seen it's equal.</p>
